# Advanced C++ Examples


## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of advanced C++ keyword examples. The examples are intended to be used as a reference for developers who are already familiar with C++ and want to learn more about the advanced features of the language.

## Examples
Each example is contained in a separate directory and includes its assembly output. The assembly output is generated using the following command:

```bash
g++ -S <code> --std=c++20
```

You can also create the executable using the following command:

```bash
g++ <code> --std=c++20 -o <executable name>
```

The assembly output is included to help developers understand how the C++ code is translated into machine code. This can be useful for understanding the performance implications of different C++ constructs.
